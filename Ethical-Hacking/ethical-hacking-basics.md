# Ethical Hacking — Basics (Beginner Notes)

## What is Ethical Hacking?
Ethical hacking is the legal and authorized process of testing systems to find and fix security weaknesses.  
It follows rules, written permission, and focuses on defense—not breaking into systems.

## Types of Ethical Hackers
- **White Hat** — Authorized, defensive  
- **Gray Hat** — Not malicious but acts without permission  
- **Black Hat** — Malicious and illegal

## Common Phases (Legal Testing Only)
1. **Reconnaissance**  
   - Collect public information (OSINT)
   - Learn about domains, IP ranges, open info

2. **Scanning**  
   - Identify open ports, services  
   - Gather system info to understand attack surface

3. **Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - Compare discovered services with known CVEs  
   - Identify weak configurations

4. **Exploitation (Only with Permission)**  
   - Test if vulnerabilities are real  
   - Validate impact

5. **Post-Exploitation**  
   - Document findings  
   - Assess risk and impact

6. **Reporting**  
   - Explain what was found  
   - How to fix it  
   - Risk rating (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

## Tools You Should Learn (Safe & Legal)
- **Nmap** — scanning and discovery  
- **Wireshark** — packet analysis  
- **Burp Suite Community** — web testing  
- **Metasploit (only in labs)** — exploit framework  
- **Hashcat/John** — password cracking (in training labs)  
- **Gobuster/Dirsearch** — directory scanning

## Safe Practice Platforms
- TryHackMe  
- HackTheBox (Easy boxes first)  
- OverTheWire  
- PortSwigger Academy

## Notes
- Always get **written permission** before testing anything.  
- Never target real systems or people.  
- Use isolated labs and learning platforms.
